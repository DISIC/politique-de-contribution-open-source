## Scope


{{%question "Am I affected by this open source contribution policy?"%}}

As stated in the introduction, if the Law for a Digital Republic applies to the entire administration, the scope of the DINSIC focuses on the
central administrations (with some exceptions according to Decree No. 2014-879 of August 1 2014).

If you are part of a local authority, this policy does not apply to you, even though the Law for a Digital Republic applies.

If you are part of an operator or a public institution under the tutelage of a ministry, you are concerned.


#### and if I belong to a research institution?

The Law for a Digital Republic applies in the same way.


#### and if I am an employee of an outsourcing company?

If you are involved in a public contract, you are concerned. However, the details of the contractual obligations will depend on the CCTP and the CCAP.


#### and if I am self-employed / self-entrepreneur?

If you work for an administration within the scope of the DINSIC, you are also concerned.

{{%question "Which codes are intended to be open?" %}}

The obligation to open the codes is related to the Digital Republic lw which plans a gradual opening until October 7, 2018. At
this date, all codes that have economic, social, sanitary or environmental value must be opened by default.

Any code written as part of a public service mission is publishable and reusable for other purposes, except for the following:
- The code must be completed (i.e. put into production)
- This communication must not undermine:
    - A secret protected by law (commercial or industrial secret of a third party, etc.)
    - State security, and public security of people or government information systems
    - Research or prevention of offenses of any kind

## Miscellaneous

{{%question "Do I need to get validation before I publish code?" %}}

Although a pre-authorization by default is proposed by the DINSIC, it may be necessary to obtain the approval of your supervisor (the same way you have validated your training proposed by the training department). For the publication of a new code base and not a contribution to an existing code, you will need to obtain a repository on your organization's account.

{{%question "My administration does not have an organization account on the online code hosting service I want to use. What should I do?" %}}

If it is not the case, contact the support email address provided in this policy.

{{%question "I do not dare to make my first commit in public, can I get help?" %}}

We advise you to identify someone who is closest to your organization and has already made a public contribution to help you.

If you can not identify someone, you can contact the support email address provided in the policy, so that we can help you find peers.
